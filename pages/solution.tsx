        DigiServices aims to overcome the limits of physical contracts by providing a platform that enables
        parties to create contracts stored in the Cardano blockchain. The platform builds members trust
        based on token rewards and penalties, supported by a Credit Assessment System (CAS) able to
        address every platform member.

        <Text as="p" fontSize="lg" textAlign="justify">
        The reward-penalty system is an algorithm that collects statistics related to the service transactions,
        user reviews, and other activities. It returns the amount of tokens that will be rewarded. Parties that
        refuse to follow the rules defined in the contract will be penalized by losing tokens proportionate to
        the severity of their violation. In extreme cases membership access to the platform will be
        suspended.

        <Text as="p" fontSize="lg" textAlign="justify">
        In such as case all membership account own assets, such as DSET are burnt. Of course the member
        can still register again to the platform. This is one of draw-backs of anonymity, but membership
        access fees can partially prevent abuses

        By integrating real-world reliable inputs with strict on-chain contracts, DigiServices aims to

        flexibility needed to communicate with the real world.
